# about-me

Lab project where we used prompts and conditional statements to make interactive responses using alerts. I ask 5 questions of the user and give them their score out of 5 at the end of the quiz. 

prompt structure into alert is as follows: if the user answers y/yes (not case-sensitive), then they will recieve a certain outcome alert which is either 'Correct!' or 'Incorrect!', and the same happens if the user types in n/no. if the user types in any other response, the user will recieve an alert with text 'Wrong input.' 

The user is given a point for each correct answer and is given the total of their points at the end of the quiz. in addition, in console there are messages that update the score for each question as well as provide the answer after the user has already answered the question.
